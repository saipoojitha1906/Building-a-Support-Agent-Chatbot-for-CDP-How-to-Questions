A chatbot that provides step-by-step guidance for "how-to" questions related to four major Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot extracts relevant information from the official documentation to help users perform specific tasks or achieve outcomes within these platforms.

## **Features**
1. **Answer "How-to" Questions**  
   - Responds to user queries such as:
     - *"How do I set up a new source in Segment?"*  
     - *"How can I create a user profile in mParticle?"*  
   - Retrieves precise and actionable steps directly from the documentation.
   
2. **Documentation Navigation**  
   - Fetches and indexes content from the official documentation of the four CDPs.  
   - Dynamically retrieves relevant sections to answer user questions.  

3. **Question Variations Handling**  
   - Understands different phrasings and variations of user queries.  
   - Handles irrelevant questions gracefully.

4. **Bonus Features**  
   - **Cross-CDP Comparisons**: Explains differences in functionalities or processes between Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap.  
   - **Advanced "How-to" Questions**: Supports queries about complex configurations, integrations, and use cases.

## **Usage**
1. **Run the Chatbot**:
   - Open a terminal and start the Flask app.  
   - Alternatively, deploy the application to a cloud service like Heroku or AWS for public access.

2. **Ask Questions**:
   - Use the web interface or API endpoint to ask questions about Segment, mParticle, Lytics, or Zeotap.
   - Example API request (via Postman or cURL):
     ```json
     POST /chat
     {
       "query": "How do I build an audience segment in Lytics?"
     }
     ```
